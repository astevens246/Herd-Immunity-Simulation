What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
    Population Size: 100
    Vaccination Percentage: 20.0%
    Virus Name: TestVirus
    Mortality Rate: 10.0%
    Reproduction Rate: 0.5
    Number of People Initially Infected: 5


What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
    percentage_infected = 100 * (1 - total_living / pop_size)
    About 5% based on the simulation


What percentage of the population died from the virus?
    percentage_dead = 100 * (total_dead / pop_size)
    About 5% based on the simulation



Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
    vaccination_saves = sim.logger.get_vaccination_interactions()
    Number of vaccination saves: 0
