What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
Population Size: 100
Vaccination Percentage: 20.0%
Virus Name: TestVirus
Mortality Rate: 10.0%
Reproduction Rate: 0.5
Number of People Initially Infected: 5


What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

What percentage of the population died from the virus?

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
